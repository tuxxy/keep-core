// confirms, so surfacing it lets operators intervene (e.g. mempool acceleration
// or CPFP) promptly.
//
// The monitor only emits a metric and a warn-level log identifying the wallet
// and transaction; automated recovery (fee-bumping / RBF) is intentionally out
// of scope (see threshold-network/keep-core#4171). Alerting is left to the
// operator's monitoring stack. Every wallet operator that broadcasts a given
// transaction tracks it independently, so the metric and log are emitted per
// operator and should be de-duplicated by transaction hash downstream.
//

// the node restarts is not re-tracked (it was broadcast by the previous
// process), so cross-restart stuck transactions are not detected here; they
